# Fox Groover
Fox Groover is an independently made project intended for experimental use in blockchain applications. It is a 2D platformer game, where you play as a fox, using movement and jumps to defeat enemies and collect items. Use the left and right arrow keys to move, and `spacebar` to jump. Jump on enemies to defeat them, and collect as many items as possible! The jewels also give you a bonus mega-jump buff for a short period.

## Project Setup
This game is a Unity project. To access it, download the project as a ZIP, extract the folder, and open it as an existing project through Unity Hub.
